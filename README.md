### Async

The methods are marked as `async` for compability between the native and wasm target.

### Testing

Hardware tests are run before merging a PR and then on `main`. The test runner is a self-hosted Linux x86_64 machine, it is connected to an Arduino Leonardo (ATmega32u4) via micro USB connection.

Tests are reviewed and triggered by maintainers on PRs to prevent malicious execution. Load [this sketch](https://github.com/webusb/arduino/blob/gh-pages/demos/console/sketch/sketch.ino) into yours to run the tests locally.

When writing tests you might encounter frequent Io / NoDevice errors, this can be due to loose wired connection. Mark these tests as `#[flaky_test::flaky_test]`.
